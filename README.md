## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Queries


### What I learned

I understand better on positioning HTML elements with the use of flexbox.


```css
main {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still trying to perfect my skills on Flexbox and Grids.
